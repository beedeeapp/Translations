# We're using YAML to list all user-facing app-strings in this file.
# To make this machine-readable, we need to respect the YAML syntax. This means leaving the spaces and indentation as-is,
# and to wrap any line that contains a colon (:), single quote ('), double quote (") or hyphen (-) in double quotes
# and 'escape' double quotes (replacing " with \"). You'll see plenty of examples of this throughout this file.
# Two more special YAML feature we use is we use a vertical bar (|) to start a block of multi-line text,
# and multiple lines starting with hypens (-) when we have a 'list' of text for a certain field (e.g. the 'steps'
# to enable location sharing on iOS).
# 
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for further reading on YAML
# Thank you for helping to make BeeDee available in different languages! ❤
